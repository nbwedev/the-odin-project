## Project Description

This project will use Objects, Object constructors and Document Object Model manipulation.


## Analysis

This project required me to apply all previous knowledge I learned with HTML and CSS and combined it with JavaScript concept: object and object constructor and DOM Manipulation.

The basic idea was to create multiple instances of book objects, store them on an array and display them using HTML and DOM.

I had a hard time with this project since it basically exposed my problem with creating a markup layout. I had to make adjustments how I created my HTML file so I can properly interact it with CSS and JS DOM.  This is a room for improvement.  Also, I need to change how I name my variables to make it more readable.

Interacting with elements through the DOM was the biggest challenge, followed by implementing the object constructor. I watched several tutorials to better understand which selectors to use and how to manipulate elements effectively.

Overall, this felt more like a DOM-focused project than one centered on object constructors.
