<!-- project info -->

<!-- Note: DOM elements should be created using JavaScript but styling can be done in a separate CSS file. -->

<!-- You must:

Empty everything inside <div id="content"> in your HTML

Create the homepage entirely with JavaScript

Put that logic in a separate module (e.g., home.js)

Import and run that function from index.js when the page loads -->

<!--
 Assets page needs to be inside src folder
 You need an appropriate loader added on webpack.config.js if you want to use the img on the assets folder

 -->
